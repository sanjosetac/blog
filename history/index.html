    <p>The history is now spacious, airy and comfortable church with the residents of
    San Joseare supremely blessed with, is a story of people’s continued and
    unceasing struggle for a decentplace where to commune with Almighty , sans
    doubt, fear no despair. It is a story of a peopledream comes true.</p>
    <p>
    The old
    church built sometime in 1904 under the inspiring leadership of Fr. Jose de
    laPena, was located near the present main gate. It was simply structure of first
    class round timberposts and corrugated GI roof and walls. Its mains door which
    faced the serene and untroubledCancabato byways 5 meters from the narrow street
    traversing the center of the lot whereusually passed the Letranco, the only
    passenger vehicles which the people ride in going to“sawang”, now “downtown”. At
    the middle of the right side when facing the altar, was thepulpet about 8feet
    above the floor on durable round post with winding stairs where the priestwould
    climb up to deliver his sermon. To the right stood the lonely kampanaryo where
    hang tobells, big and small, everyday to be pealed loudly and sonorously on
    tistive celebrations, or tobe tolled when a barriohanon pass away. At the left
    end was a hut where lived an old couple,Baltazar Costudio and Regina Alonzo, the
    church caretakers from whom the priest would getthe vestment for the mass tidily
    kept on ba-ol mundo. During fiestas children in their “bos-ogs”would gaily
    around munching roscas with enviable appetite while their mothers’ lamenly
    swingback and forth their abanikos inside. Beit “Bonafonte” or “La Invention”,
    the well rehearsedchoir would always be on the watch for the strokes of the
    batonof the conductor. Afterconscretion, immediately fallows the successive
    hissing and soaring of the kwetes and burstingof the bombas while the band
    briskly plays the Philippines National Anthe. This could be signalfor the
    “Ginang may bahay” to already prepare the table as the mass is about to end.
    </p>
    <p>
    To
    the front of the church would usually be erected by law abiding and God-fearing
    menin pintakasi, the entablado where the colorful and action-packed Hadi- Hadi,
    a drama depictingthe tribal wars between the Christian and the Moros of old,
    would be staged. The show wouldlast up to the wee hours of morning specially
    when thefellowin the giant’s garb would not liedown defeated as was in the plot
    because the prince hit him hard and he wanted to retaliate.For variation dramas
    like”Diri Daraga, Diri Balo, Diri Inasaw-an”, written by Dadoy Lucente
    andproduced and directed by Pedro Separa would be shown. Lighting was supplied
    just by pressurelamps, but, there were no “brown outs”.
    </p>
    <p>
    Early in 1944, the
    Japanese Imperial Navy ordered the evacuation of San Jose inpreparation for the
    battled against the forces of Gen. Douglas MacArthur which was already 2.
    nearing the Philippines in fulfilment of his historic promise,”I shall return”.
    Houses weredemolished, including of the San Jose church. Trenches were dug
    around the barrio. The Japswere bent to drive back the Liberation Forces their
    fighting slogan being “Stand back forces ofevil or perish in combat”.
    </p>
    <p>
    After the
    smoke of the bursting shells of the cannons of giant battleship and bombs ofthe
    Hellcat dive bombers of the American Liberation Forces cleared, San Jose was
    pocked withdeep craters, the church site included. The situation was aggravated
    when the power shovels ofthe occupation troops dug up the place to use the coral
    sand to surface the muddy roadsdestroyed by the chained wheels of vehicles of
    wars of all sorts and types. The church site wasleft about 2 fathoms deep under
    water.
    </p>
    <p>
    In trickle, the barrio residents began returning from evacuation. Upon
    seeing the actualpicture, upon foreseeing the seeming impossibility of restoring
    San Jose to normal shape in theleast, because a mountain had to levelled down to
    fill the excavation a job which thegovernment would not undertake because the
    lots involved were private properties, thecommon question realadable from their
    faces was”Quo Vadis”?
    </p>
    <p>
    In May 1945’San Jose celebrated its first postwar fiesta.
    Churchless, the HermanoMayor, Flaviano Bato, had the mass said at the chapel of
    the Replacement Battalion of theOccupation Forces at sitio Cogon.
    </p>
    <p>
    In 1946, a son
    of San Jose, Hermogenes Daantos, who became Vice Mayor of Tacloban,initiated the
    construction of temporary church on a lot owned by Alejandro
    Pretencio.Theremasses were said by turns by the priest of Redemptorist
    Missionary and Sto. Niño Parish. Thepeople wanted to build a permanent church on
    Pretencio’s lot in exchange for the lot still underwater, swapping did not push
    through. Alejndro Pretencio wanted as condition, to collect thewar damage
    payment for the church lot to which the people did not agree.
    </p>
    <p>
    In 1956, Pedro D.
    Separa, PAL Manager and City Councillor of Tacloban City, was able tosway his
    colleagues to have the garbage of Tacloban City dumped at San Jose with priority
    atthe churches’ site. In the process, the whole bario was swarmed with flies. An
    epidemicoutbreak was likely, but the people were steadfast in their conviction
    that Saint Joseph won’tlet them down. After 5 years of patience, the bottom at
    last came up to the surface. Separa wasmade Hermano Mayor for 1961. A stage was
    constructed at the newly reclaimed area surfacewith truckloads of sea sand and a
    drama produced and directed by the Hermano Mayor himselfwas stage.
    </p>
    <p>
    Plans were
    then made to start construction of the church but, they were ended evenbefore
    they were begun. Reason? No sufficient funds.
    </p>
    <p>
    When Cursillo Movement was in
    bloom in 1964,when practically all big and small shotsalike in government and
    private entities of Tacloban City, were one in heart and mind singingand
    shouting “Decolores”, the theme song and password of the movement, the
    construction ofthe San Jose church was made their pilot project. Without much
    ado, the cornerstone was laidby Msgr. Lino Gonzaga with a company of priest of
    the diocese, attended by Gov. NorbertoRomualdez and party, City Mayor Artemio
    Mate and party, District Engineer Bernardo Apostoland party and several
    professional and ordinary citizens of Tacloban City and nearby towns. Bythe
    enthusiasm expressed by the multitude, even a cathedral would not be impossible
    to build.It was young and energetic Fr. Almendra who was assigned in take charge
    of the project. All hisproblems about dump trucks to be use in hauling sand and /
    or gravel donated by constructioncompanies were answered by Antonio C. Separa, a
    cursilista and Chief of the LandTransportation Commission of Tacloban City.
    </p>
    <p>
    Despite omission after omission which seemed more of a blessing in disguise
    becausetime was needed really for the garbage to shrink, the church construction
    was startedDecember 10, 1966 with Engr.Salvador S. Santiago as Chairman of the
    Committee onconstruction. The plan was drawn by Roger Almaden, a B.S Arch. And
    the design was sort ofgothic with 3 spires at the front. Inquisitively following
    up the construction was Flaviano Bato,Hermano Mayor for 1967, a man who was
    always in a hurry.
    </p>
    <p>
    On April 16, 1967, Msgr.Manuel Salvador issued a decree
    creating the RedemptoristMissionary a regular parish, making San Jose under its
    jurisdiction. Active as always, theRedemptorist. Fathers at once started fund
    raising for the on-going construction. Bingo games,raffles and pledges were
    initiated. These priest were even content with accepting ten centavo(P0.10) a
    week from every house. One thing was sure. Every hard earned centavo would go to
    amaterial bought. No one man could by just his whims and caprices order the
    release of funds.Legal procedures in handling and disbursement of funds were
    followed.
    </p>
    <p>
    Not to be forgotten also are the CWL, ladies are though already in
    their twilight yearsbut are teeners from their looks, who have always
    uncomplainingly responded to calls for fundraising.
    </p>
    <p>
    It became incumbent upon the
    shoulders of the succeeding Hermanos to carry onunfalteringly the finishing of
    the church. Some Hermanos Pasado left visible structures and / orimprovements
    listed below while the rest just deposited with the Treasurer funds raised
    duringtheir hermanoship.
    </p>
    <p>

    When San
    Jose was under the Redemptorist Parish, no baptism, wedding, last rites forthe
    dead, etc., were allowed at the barrio’s church. The reason was lack of priests.
    It was forthis reason the San Jose people clamored to be a parish.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thus, on
    November 16, 1986, San Jose was elevated as a quasi-Parish by ArchbishopPedro
    Dean. First Moises Apostol, a young priest from Burauen who is always on the
    go.Immediately, a convent was constructed and finished February, 1987. After a
    little more than ayear, San Jose at last was fully elevated as a parish. Early
    in 1988, Hermano Mayor Benjamin Goenlarged and reconstructed the belfry to
    accommodate the big bell donated by BejoRomualdez.The Pastoral Council renovated
    the altar and it’s ceiling for fiesta celebration.Also, aparish Formation Hall
    for seminars, meetings and social gatherings was immediately laid byBishop
    Filomeno Bactol.Intensive fund raising not only locally but also abroad
    wasconducted.After just little more than year, the parish Formation Hall was at
    least usable, andinitially blessed November, 1989.
    </p>
    <p>
    Age, salty breeze and current
    typhoons made disturbing leaks on the roof of the 23 yearold still unfinished
    church. Plans were immediately drawn and renovation started January,1990.Among
    others, the telemovie “Ang Pinakamagandang Luha” was a major fund raiser.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the
    fiesta of 1990, aside from the proceeds from the “Search for the Most
    PopularMatron”, Hermano Mayores, Atty.Ramon S. Santiago and wife Estrella,
    brought home P70 000in solicited and personal fund.This went a long way in the
    church’s roof renovation. The type oftruss used is what is called in the
    engineering parlance, “inverted truss”. What else could beinverted
    </p>
    <p>
    Side by side with the PPC Prexy, Napoleon Amor, in closely supervising the
    on-goingwork was Engr.Walderio Bonifacio, Hermano Mayor of 1991, who aside from
    funds raisedduring his hermanoship, donated 2 full span trusses.
    </p>
    <p>
    Everything come
    to its end, so they say, and when that time comes how we wish it weresooner,
    gone will be raffle draws, pledges, solicitations, and the like. The very
    thought alonethat we made it despite myriad odds, will, “make our every
    yesterday a dream of happiness andevery tomorrow a vision of hope”.
